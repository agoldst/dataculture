#' Historic American Cookbook Recipes Data
#'
#' Information about 48,032 recipes from 74 American cookbooks, 1803â€“1922, including ingredients and ethnic and geographic origins.
#'
#' Slightly reprocessed from the accompanying data to Folgert Karsdorp et al., _Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python_ (Princeton University Press, 2021), chap. 1. Karsdorp et al. prepared a CSV file containing preprocessed recipe data derived from XML-encoded cookbooks in Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Dataset (East Lansing: Michigan State University Libraries Stephen O. Murray and Keelung Hong Special Collections), 2003, <https://lib.msu.edu/feedingamericadata>. That CSV file is represented as a `tbl_df` object here.
#'
#' Recipe data are derived from editorial markup: the Feeding America editors marked up recipe ingredients and assigned recipes to ethnic, meal-stage, and regional categories. Those categories are recorded unmodified here.
