\description{
Information about 48,032 recipes from 74 American cookbooks, 1803â€“1922, including ingredients and ethnic and geographic origins.
}
\details{
Slightly reprocessed from the accompanying data to Folgert Karsdorp et al., \emph{Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python} (Princeton University Press, 2021), chap. 1. Karsdorp et al. prepared a CSV file containing preprocessed recipe data derived from XML-encoded cookbooks in Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Dataset (East Lansing: Michigan State University Libraries Stephen O. Murray and Keelung Hong Special Collections), 2003, \url{https://lib.msu.edu/feedingamericadata}. That CSV file is represented as a \code{tbl_df} object here.

Recipe data are derived from editorial markup: the Feeding America editors marked up recipe ingredients and assigned recipes to ethnic, meal-stage, and regional categories. Those categories are recorded unmodified here.
